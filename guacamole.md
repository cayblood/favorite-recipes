Guacamole
=========

*Serves about six people as an appetizer, 12-15 as a dip*

### Ingredients

* 1/2 small onion, peeled and finely chopped
* 2 fresh hot green chilis, stemmed and very finely chopped (can substitute 2 red chilis that are common in Norwegian stores)
* 1 ripe large tomato, finely chopped
* 1 large clove garlic, peeled and crushed
* 10 sprigs fresh coriander, finely chopped (can substitute 2 tablespoons dried coriander)
* 3 ripe avocados
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon cider vinegar
* Grated cheese (optional)

### Directions

1. In a medium-size bowl, mix the finely chopped onion, chiles, tomato, garlic and coriander.
2. Close to the time you are going to serve, halve the avocadoes lengthwise by cutting from the stems to the flower ends around the pits, separating the halves and scraping out the pulp from the skins into the bowl.
3. Using your hand or a spoon (or a mortar and pestle), mash the avocado while mixing the other ingredients. Pour in the vinegar while mixing and salt to taste.
4. Garnish with cheese (optional).
