Salsa
=====

*Yields approximately 1 1/2 cups*

### Ingredients

* 1 ripe, large tomato
* 1 or 2 green chilis (can substitute the red chilis that are common in Norwegian stores)
* 1 small onion
* 1 large clove garlic
* 8-10 sprigs fresh coriander
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon water

### Directions

1. Core the tomato, optionally seeding it by cutting across the width and squeezing out the seeds and liquid. Chop it finely and scoop it into a small bowl.
2. If you want a milder sauce, seed the chiles, then chop them very finely and add them to the tomatoes.
3. Peel and chop the onion finely; add it to the bowl.
4. Peel the garlic clove and crush it; then add it to the bowl.
5. Finely chop the coriander and add it to the bowl.
6. Stir in the vinegar and water and mix the ingredients well.
7. Salt to taste. Best to let it sit for a little while so that the salt can interact with the vinegar and other ingredients.
